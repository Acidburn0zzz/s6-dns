<h1> The s6-dnsqr program </h1>

<p>
  s6-dnsqr is an analysis and debug tool. It performs a DNS resolution,
then prints the contents of the answer packet, and optionally debug
information during the resolution.
</p>

<h2> Interface </h2>

<pre>
     s6-dnsqr [ -1 | -2 ] [ -t <em>timeout</em> ] [ -D <em>level</em> ] <em>qtype</em> <em>domain</em>
</pre>

<ul>
 <li> s6-dnsqr makes a recursive DNS query of type <em>qtype</em> for the name <em>domain</em>.
It prints the answer packet, in human-readable form, to its standard output,
then exits 0. </li>
 <li> It does not qualify <em>domain</em>. </li>
 <li> If the resolution fails for some reason, s6-dnsqr exits 2. </li>
 <li> By default, s6-dnsqr looks for DNS cache addresses in the
<tt>/etc/resolv.conf</tt> file. If the DNSCACHEIP environment variable is set
and contains a list of IP (v4 or v6) addresses, separated by commas,
semicolons, spaces, tabs, newlines or carriage returns, then this list
is used instead. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Options </h2>

<ul>
 <li> <tt>-1</tt>&nbsp;: send debug information to stdout. </li>
 <li> <tt>-2</tt>&nbsp;: send debug information to stderr. This is the default. Not that
those options only apply to debug output, not to the regular packet dump, which
is always printed to stdout. </li>
 <li> <tt>-t</tt>&nbsp;<em>timeout</em>&nbsp;: if the resolution takes more
than <em>timeout</em> milliseconds, then it exits 99 right away with an error
message. By default, <em>timeout</em> is 0, which means no timeout. </li>
 <li> <tt>-D</tt>&nbsp;<em>level</em>&nbsp;: produce debug output during
resolution. If <em>level</em> is:
 <ul>
  <li> 0: no debug output is produced </li>
  <li> 1: information is printed when s6-dnsqr receives a DNS packet from a cache </li>
  <li> 2: information is printed before and after s6-dnsqr sends a DNS packet to a cache </li>
  <li> 3: both 1. and 2. apply </li>
 </ul>

</ul>

<h2> Notes </h2>

<ul>
 <li> TXT records are printed in a quoted form similar to
<a href="http://skarnet.org/software/s6-portable-utils/s6-quote.html">s6-quote</a>'s
output. </li>
 <li> If s6-dnsqr finds a record it cannot print, such as an unknown RR type,
it dumps its content in the same quoted form. </li>
 <li> The normal output format should be stable, so you can write programs that
automatically parse it. However, the debug output format is undocumented and subject
to change. </li>
</ul>
