<h1> The <tt>skadns</tt> library interface </h1>

<p>
 The <tt>skadns</tt> library provides an API for asynchronous DNS
resolution.
</p>

<h2> Compiling </h2>

<ul>
 <li> Make sure the s6-dns headers, as well as the skalibs headers,
are visible in your header search path. </li>
 <li> Use <tt>#include &lt;s6-dns/skadns.h&gt;</tt> </li>
 <li> You might also want to include the <tt>s6-dns/s6dns.h</tt> header for
the definition of the <tt>s6dns_domain_t</tt> type and the various
qtype constants. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Linking </h2>

<ul>
 <li> Make sure the s6 libraries, as well as the skalibs libraries,
are visible in your library search path. </li>
 <li> Link against <tt>-lskadns</tt> and <tt>-lskarnet</tt>. </li>
 <li> If you're using a skadnsd service, also add <tt>`cat $sysdeps/socket.lib`</tt>
to the end of your linking command line, <tt>$sysdeps</tt> standing for your
skalibs sysdeps directory. </li>
</ul>


<h2> Programming </h2>

<p>
 Check the <tt>s6-dns/skadns.h</tt> header for the
exact function prototypes.
</p>

<p>
 Make sure your application is not disturbed by children it doesn't
know it has. This means paying some attention to the SIGCHLD handler,
if any, and to the way you perform <tt>waitpid()</tt>s. The best
practice is to use a
<a href="//skarnet.org/software/skalibs/libstddjb/selfpipe.html">self-pipe</a>
to handle SIGCHLD (as well as other signals the application needs to trap),
and to <em>always</em> use <tt>wait_nohang()</tt> to reap children,
simply ignoring pids you don't know.
</p>

<p>
 If your (badly programmed) application has trouble handling unknown
children, consider using a skadnsd service.
</p>

<h3> A programming example </h3>

<p>
 The <tt>src/clients/s6dns_generic_filter_main.c</tt> file in the s6-dns
package, used in the <tt>s6-dns*-filter</tt> programs, illustrates how to
use the skadns library.
</p>

<h3> Starting and ending a session </h3>

<pre>
skadns_t a = SKADNS_ZERO ;
tain_t deadline, stamp ;

tain_now(&amp;stamp) ;
tain_addsec(&amp;deadline, &amp;stamp, 2)

// char const *path = SKADNS_IPCPATH ;
// skadns_start(&amp;a, path, &amp;deadline, &amp;stamp) ;
skadns_startf(&amp;a, &amp;deadline, &amp;stamp) ;
</pre>

<p>
<tt>skadns_start</tt> starts a session with a skadnsd service, listening
on <em>path</em>. <br />
<tt>skadns_startf</tt> starts a session with a skadnsd process as a child
(which is the simplest usage). <br />
<tt>a</tt> is a skadns_t structure that must be declared and
initialized to SKADNS_ZERO.
<tt>stamp</tt> must be an accurate enough timestamp. <br />
If the session initialization fails, the function returns 0 and errno is set;
else the function returns 1.
</p>
<p>
If the absolute time <tt>deadline</tt> is reached and the function
has not returned yet, it immediately returns 0 with errno set to ETIMEDOUT.

Only local interprocess communications are involved; unless your system is
heavily overloaded, the function should return near-instantly. One or two
seconds of delay between <tt>stamp</tt> and <tt>deadline</tt> should be
enough: if the function takes more than that to return, then there is a
problem with the underlying processes.
</p>

<p>
 You can have more than one session open in parallel, by declaring
several distinct <tt>skadns_t</tt> structures and calling
<tt>skadns_startf</tt> (or <tt>skadns_start</tt>) more than once.
However, this is only useful if you need to perform more than
SKADNS_MAXCONCURRENCY, i.e. a thousand, concurrent requests. In
most situations, a single skadns session will be enough.
</p>

<pre>
skadns_end(&amp;a) ;
</pre>

<p>
<tt>skadns_end</tt> frees all the resources used by the session. The
<tt>a</tt> structure is then reusable for another session.
</p>

<h3> Sending a DNS query </h3>

<pre>
s6dns_domain_t d ;
uint16_t qtype ;
uint16_t id ;
tain_t limit, deadline, stamp ;

skadns_send(&amp;a, &amp;id, &amp;d, qtype, &amp;limit, &amp;deadline, &amp;stamp) ;
</pre>

<p>
<tt>skadns_send</tt> starts the asynchronous resolution of domain <em>d</em>
with query type <em>qtype</em>. <em>d</em> must be encoded in packet form.
<em>stamp</em> must be an accurate enough timetamp.
If the resolution hasn't completed by deadline <em>limit</em>, it will
automatically fail with a status set to ETIMEDOUT.
</p>

<p>
 Like <tt>skadns_startf()</tt>, the <tt>skadns_send()</tt> call
is synchronous but should not be blocking; however, if it hasn't returned by
deadline <em>deadline</em>, it then returns 0 with errno set to ETIMEDOUT.
On failure, the call returns 0 and sets errno. On success, it returns 1 and
<em>id</em> is set to a 16-bit number identifying the query.
</p>

<h3> Cancelling a query </h3>

<pre>
skadns_cancel(&amp;a, id, &amp;deadline, &amp;stamp) ;
</pre>

<p>
 <tt>skadns_cancel</tt> cancels the resolution identified by <em>id</em>.
<em>stamp</em> must be an accurate enough timestamp.
The call returns 1 on success, or 0 (and sets errno) on failure. It is
synchronous but should return almost-instantly; if it hasn't returned
by <em>deadline</em>, it then returns 0 ETIMEDOUT.
</p>

<p>
 After a query has been successfully canceled, its id can be discarded.
</p>

<h3> Asynchronously waiting for answers </h3>

<p>
<em> (from now on, the functions are listed with their prototypes instead
of usage examples.) </em>
</p>

<pre>
int skadns_fd (skadns_t const *a)
</pre>

<p>
 Returns a file descriptor to select on for reading. Do not
<tt>read()</tt> it though.
</p>

<pre>
int skadns_update (skadns_t *a)
</pre>

<p>
 Call this function whenever the fd checks readability: it will
update <em>a</em>'s internal structures with information from the
<a href="skadnsd.html">skadnsd</a> daemon. It returns -1 if an error
occurs; in case of success, it returns the number of identifiers for
which something happened.
</p>

<p>
 When <tt>skadns_update</tt> returns,
<tt>genalloc_s(uint16, &amp;a-&gt;list)</tt> points to an array of
<tt>genalloc_len(uint16, &amp;a-&gt;list)</tt> 16-bit unsigned
integers. Those integers are valid ids that can be used with the
following functions.
</p>

<pre>
char const *skadns_packet (skadns_t *a, uint16_t id)
int skadns_packetlen (skadns_t *a, uint16_t id)
</pre>

<p>
 <tt>skadns_packet()</tt> returns a pointer to the DNS packet
containing the answer to the query identified by <em>id</em>,
and <tt>skadns_packetlen()</tt> returns its length. If an
error has occurred, <tt>skadns_packet()</tt> returns NULL and
<tt>skadns_packetlen()</tt> returns -1; either call sets errno
to a value identifying the error. Some errno values have a
special meaning:
</p>

<ul>
 <li> EAGAIN: the result has not arrived yet. </li>
 <li> ECANCELED: the query has been canceled. </li>
 <li> EINVAL: <em>id</em> does not identify a valid query. Note
that <strong>if</strong> you get EINVAL, <strong>then</strong>
<em>id</em> is invalid, but the reverse is not true: 
using invalid ids is a programming error and may result in a crash. </li>
</ul>

<pre>
int skadns_release (skadns_t *a, uint16_t id)
</pre>

<p>
  <tt>skadns_release()</tt> frees the cell holding the result of
query <em>id</em>. It returns 1 on success, then <em>id</em> can
be discarded - further calls to <tt>skadns_send()</tt> may reuse
the same number.
</p>

<p>
 <tt>skadns_release()</tt> may fail, and return 0. This signals a
programming error and shouldn't be relied on - however, if it happens,
errno can help you identify the problem:
</p>

<ul>
 <li> EBUSY: the query is still pending, cancelled or not. </li>
 <li> EINVAL: <em>id</em> is invalid.
</ul>
